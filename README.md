### Project Details

Besides finishing WDI, you surely have one or two things you'd love to do with your life. Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a third-party location-based API to allow users to search for a location or venue to add to their bucket list items.

Reach Goal: Add social features to your site, such as following other users. Allow users to make certain list items public, but default to private.

-Planning-
What are we building?
  * A bucketlist app where users can log in, and set up lists of activites they want to experience.
Who are we building for?
  * All users that are looking to travel and/or find things to do in the area(s) that they want to visit.

-User Stories-
-create list
  -create empty unique list #success
-search
  -things to do in area
  -looking at list of results #success
-add item to list
  -item is on list #success
-user complete task
  -bucketlist task marked complete #success

As a user I want to be able to create lists of places I'd like to go and what it will take to get me there.
As a user I want to be able to update and delete lists.
As a user I want to be able to set due dates for goals.

-Basic features-
  -CRUD ability
  -Log in/user authorization
  -Section for ideas that users can look through for the areas they wish to visit

-Pages needed in app
  -Homepage; pics/info about site/logo/link to personal dashboard/link to ideas page
  -Dashboard; ideas link/search bar/form to add goal, edit goal, delete goal, mark as complete/edit profile/show active & completed goals.
